                // If data exists and there is no error then store the data in the let constant. then we are going to set the image equal to the data that was retrieved from the datatask with the url. This is downloading the image meaning taking the data retrieved and converting it into a UIImage and setting it to the personImage. Now that you have retrieved data and then created a UIImage out of it and set that UIImage to the PersonImage outlet you can now downloadFaceID of that UIImage.

        // must call .resume in order to start DataSession with URL passed in. THis basically sets a datatask in which it retireves data, and then after that is done it calls the completion handler which returns back data, a response, and an error if it exists.
        
        
          
        

    // You need to retrieve the data for the images by passing in a url and then in the completion handler retrieving data, response, and error. Then for configuration, a string url is going to be passed in that represents an image from a server and essentially you need to convert that to NSURL and then do a data session then a data task where you retrieve data and then set the detail equal to a UIImage.
